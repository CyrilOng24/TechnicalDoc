Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014.
      </p>

      <p>
        Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future.[2][3][4][5] Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.[5] In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or spike actions. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.

    <article>
      <p> If you are new to shooters, it can feel daunting at first, but itâ€™s easy to feel comfortable even with experienced squads once you get the hang of how things work.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Take advantage of the high ground and sneaky angles to take enemies by surprise. The TTK (time-to-kill) is very low in Valorant, so getting a jump on enemies can offer a massive advantage in fights.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is essential to coordinate with your teammates to assure your chances of success. Valorant is a team shooter, and if you are unable to communicate and help your team, you will not find success in the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some agents can work together and create cool combos. You can also combine abilities with your weapons. Take advantage of your smokes and disruption abilities to give yourself an edge.
        </li>

    <header>Agent Selection</header>
    <article>

      <p>
  Agents have one Signature Ability which they get for free each round.

Riot was aiming to launch the game with 12 agents, but only 8 were available in the early press builds. The March 29, 2020, private event introduced Breach. Since the Closed Beta launch on April 7, 2020, Raze was added along with the map Split, bringing the Agent total to 10. Five agents are available at first launch, with two more that can be easily unlocked by leveling up in the game. More agents can be unlocked by taking Contracts and gathering XP on them.

Agents have a base health of 100; Light Shields bring the maximum health to 125, and Heavy Shields to 150.

It is the intention of the developers that one agent be released per act.

    <header>Game Modes</header>
    <article>
      Game Modes are different types of modes that can be played in VALORANT. Most modes can be categorized as either Plant/Defuse-style or Deathmatch-style. Players can access five modes at a time, with four permanent (Unrated, Competitive, Spike Rush, and Deathmatch) and one other that is part of a rotating game mode queue that changes every patch (Escalation, Replication, and Snowball Fight).

    <header>Unrated Game</header>
    <p>
      Unrated is VALORANT's standard Plant/Defuse mode. Teams play 12 rounds on Attack or Defense, then swap to the other side for the next 12 rounds. The first to 13 rounds wins (Bo25), with a final Sudden Death round played should the game reach a 12-12 scoreline.

This mode lasts for 30-40 minutes.
    </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
    <header>Rank Game</header>
    <p>Competitive is a higher stakes version of Unrated where you play competitively against other players to earn and compete for a rank.

Should a game reach a 12-12 scoreline, the games instead goes into Overtime where the first team to get a 2-round lead on their opponent wins the game. Players can vote every two rounds on whether to continue Overtime, which can result in the game ending in a draw should enough players vote for this option.

This mode lasts for 30-40 minutes.</p>

    <header>Spike Rush</header>
    <article>
      <p>
      Spike Rush is a Bo7 5v5 mode where all players start each round with the same random weapon. Random orbs spawn around the map that players can collect to grant buff for themselves and/or their teammates or afflict enemies with debuffs.

This mode lasts for 8-12 minutes.

    <header>DeathMatch</header>
    <article>
      <p>
       Deathmatch is a 14-player free-for-all game mode designed to allow players to hone their gunplay mechanics or warm up before playing Competitive. Players equip weapons of their choice and kill anyone in their way until either a player reaches 40 kills or 9 minutes have passed, at which point the game will end.

Deathmatch grants 900 XP for completing the game, but cannot be used to complete missions.

    <article>
      <p>
       Practice Game Modes are a series of modes that you can play in the Range. These series of modes will let you have a taste of how VALORANT games will work.

Spike Planting

Spike Defuse
Methodically defeat enemies and defuse the Spike before time runs out!

        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
      </p>

      <p>
        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
        represent a variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope. For example:

    <header>Replication</header>
    <article>
      <p>Replication is 5v5 Bo9 mode where all players on a team play as the same agent. Players vote for an agent they want to play and the game then randomly selects one of the choices.

Replication has an estimated game time of 10-15 minutes and grants the same amount of XP as Unrated (100 XP per round plus 200 XP for every won round).</p>
